## Random Number Generator

### Overview

I was curious about how random numbers are picked by a computer, so I decided to try creating my own random number generator. It's pretty straightforward but was a cool little project to see how we can get random (or sort of random) numbers from a list. This was just a fun experiment to learn more about programming! I recognize that this method is quite simple and there are more sophisticated and efficient ways to generate random numbers. But for me, this project was more about exploring the concept and getting hands-on experience with the basics of randomness in programming.
