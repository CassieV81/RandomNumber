## Random Number Generator

### Overview

I was curious about how random numbers are picked by a computer, so I decided to try creating my own random number generator. It's pretty straightforward but was a cool little project to see how we can get random (or sort of random) numbers from a list. Just a fun experiment to learn more about programming!
